Infrastructure
 o clean up interfaces between various components
    - use static functions ffs
    - use list.h for doubly linked lists
    - code cleanups
 o vprintf has no %p, and might be quite bogus
 o panic function
 o sprinkle -EFOO error codes around

Memory Management
 o Use e820 maps to initialise buddy system
 o Finish off the buddy system
 o Implement kfree()
 o Support order > 0 in slab allocator (implement coalescing in free_page)

Scheduling / Synchronisation
 o task switcher is just wrong
    - save all regs + eflags
    - irq handling is bogus, do not schedule from ISR context
    - add bottom half/tasklet context
 o Get rid of cli/sti as locking primitives
 o Better semaphores / wait queues
 o Disable pre-emption in kernel mode for now

Drivers
 o Make arch-independent drivers
 o Improve floppy driver
 o Finish PCI code
 o ATA Hard disk driver
 o USB stack :)

Virtual Filesystem Switch
 o cache inodes
 o cache dentries
 o mount/umount API

Program Execution
 o Flesh out struct task
 o System calls
 o Page cache
 o User mode tasks
